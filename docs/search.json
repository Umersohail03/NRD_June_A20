    "text": "Reference Studies:\n\nMA et al., 2020\nHR Lehto et al., 2021\n\nStudy Objective:\nTo evaluate the risk of 30-day all-cause hospital readmission in patients undergoing CABG, comparing those with diabetes and those without diabetes. The study also characterizes index hospitalization outcomes and readmission stay features.
